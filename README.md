# MapleStory 2 Boss Timer

World Boss timer for MapleStory 2 (NA/EU).

## GitHub Pages & Jekyll

The GitHub pages are updated automatically when deploying to `master`. This uses Jekyll to build the site after any changes.

Requirements:

- [Ruby 2.5.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Setup

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
jekyll serve --livereload
```

This will then run on `localhost:4000` and automatically reload when you change any files.

Updating of the site will happen when a push is made to the `master` branch.
